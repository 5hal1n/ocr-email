# Project Context: ocr-email

## Overview
This repository, `ocr-email`, currently appears to be a fresh or empty project. Based on the name, it is likely intended for a system involving **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** applied to **emails**, possibly for extracting data from email attachments or bodies.

## Directory Structure
- The directory is currently empty (except for `.git` metadata and this file).

## Getting Started
Since there is no code yet, consider the following next steps:
1.  **Initialize the project:** Choose a language (e.g., Python, TypeScript) and package manager.
2.  **Define Requirements:** Determine the OCR engine (e.g., Tesseract, Google Cloud Vision) and email protocol (IMAP, SMTP, or API integrations like Gmail API).
3.  **Update this file:** As the project grows, update this `GEMINI.md` with build instructions, architectural details, and conventions.
